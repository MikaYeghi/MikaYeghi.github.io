I am a Research Assistant in the Advanced Controls Research Laboratory (ACRL) at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at **Carnegie Mellon University** in the Human Sensing Lab. I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Engineering Science from the **University of Oxford**.

My research focuses on developing robust and trustworthy multi-modal AI. I have mainly worked with vision and language, but I am open to exploring other modalities as well. Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
